# ES6-Workshop Docker Compose

To use, [install Docker with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Then run the following:

```
docker-compose up
```

Docker will build the container & then run the tests. Once this is done, any changes you make in your local exercises directory will cause the tests to be re-run in the container.
